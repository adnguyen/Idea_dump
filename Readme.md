# Idea Dumps!



### Author: Andrew D. Nguyen



This repository just has some random markdown or Rmarkdown files outlining ideas or learning ideas. 



One outstanding issue in evolutionary physiology is how we more precisely think about resistance and tolerance. See: *2018-2019_Evolution_of_Physiological_tactics.Rmd* and *The Evolution of the resistance and tolerance to stress.md*

For *Proteostasis.Rmd*, it is a file that constructs a venn diagram of how we can think of protein homeostasis. There are different routes in which organisms/cells can maintain the function of a protein. 

For *Bayesian.Rmd* , I was following a course recorded on youtube: [Statistical REthinking Fall 2017](<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oy7Ks3YfbDg&list=PLDcUM9US4XdM9_N6XUUFrhghGJ4K25bFc>) .
